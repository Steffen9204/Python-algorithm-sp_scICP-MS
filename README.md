# Python-algorithm-sp/scICP-MS
Suitability: Python post-processing algorithm for single particle / single cell ICP-MS (quadrupole based) suitable for Thermo and Agilent

<b>1)  General Information: </b><br>
*The Python algorithm is created using Anaconda Navigator (2.6.0) and JupiterLab (2.2.6). We suggest to download this software. Otherwise a python script is also available (.py) but is not tested from our site.<br>
*The anaconda environment is provided in the main path ('2024_10_base_clone.yaml') and can be integrated in anaconda navigator: Environments --> Import --> Choose File<br>
*After that, it can be chosen as default: File --> Preferences --> Default conda environment --> choose environment<br>
*Now install the right JupiterLab Version (2.2.6) and 'Launch'<br>
<br><br>
<b>2) Create Folders </b><br>
*Create for each sample one folder --> Add ONE csv. file output and the code file (!IMPORTANT: Make sure only one .csv is in the same folder with the code file!) <br>
*Open the code file with e.g. JupiterLab

<b>3) Calculation of transport efficiencies </b><br>
*Use the reference material code (Example Au) to calculate the transport efficiencies and/or interpret Au particle data <br>
*Suggested to measure the reference materials for the transport efficiency
