# Python-algorithm-sp/scICP-MS
Python post-processing algorithm for single particle / single cell ICP-MS (quadrupole based) suitable for Thermo and Agilent

The Python algorithm is created using Anaconda Navigator (2.6.0) and JupiterLab (2.2.6). We suggest to download this software. Otherwise a python script is also available (.py) but is not tested from our site.
